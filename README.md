To reproduce this work, please follow the following steps.

## Step 1
Clone the repository

## Step 2
This work has been done on the Movielens ML-1m and ML-20m dataset. To download the dataset, just execute the ```data_download_script.sh``` script. It can be executed using the following command - 

```sh data_download_script.sh```

The script now only has the ML-20m download instructions. Similar instructions can be added for ML-1m. Alternatively, these datasets can be downloaded manually and used as well.
